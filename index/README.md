#Testing instructions

* Build the program by simply running `make` in the directory.
* To run the program, you **must** change into the executable directory (`exe`)
* * The program is hardcoded to read from the `dataset-format` directory that must be located in the same directory as the executable
* * * The `dataset-format` directory is generated by running the `crawler.py` and `formater.py` python scripts in the `wiki_crawler` folder
* It helps to delete the `disk-index` folder in between program runs when trying to debug from an empty index
